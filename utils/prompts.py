    "Generate a cave painting that symbolically represents the topic '{topic}' as imagined by early "
    "humans. Use a primitive, prehistoric style with simple, rough shapes and earthy pigments like "
    "ochre, charcoal, and clay. Render the image on a textured cave wall, incorporating natural elements "
    "such as faded handprints, torchlight shadows, animals, or human figures to enhance the ancient, "
    "symbolic aesthetic. The artwork should feel raw and interpret the concept through the lens of early "
    "human storytelling."
